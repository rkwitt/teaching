# Machine Learning (VO)

## News

- The VO will be held **fully online**
- Our Google meet link for the **Q&A** sessions is [here](https://meet.google.com/zka-jpyj-hmg)

## Scheduled Q&A sessions

- **`03/01/2021`** (11:30am - *Vorbesprechung* VO/PS combined)

## Organization

The course is structured as a series of lectures. For each lecture, I will provide *videos* that can be downloaded and watched whenever you prefer. 

*I do recommend that you watch the lecture videos in the provided order.*

I will also provide, on a regular basis, an **online Q&A session** (via Google meet, see link above), where you can ask questions, or raise issues that have come up while studying the material. My plan is to do this every other week (Mondays 11am). The dates can be found [here](#Scheduled-Q&A-sessions).

## Slack channel

The slack channel #machinelearning is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** (open-book type) at the end of the course.

## Lecture material

The course is rather self-contained and most of the material will be developed step-by-step on the blackboard (which is my iPad now :). To every video, I will also provide a PDF with my written notes.

Additionally, you can find most of the material in my supporting [slides](ml.pdf)
, and in the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David (see below) which is my main reference for the course.  

### Staying up-to-date

Please, **always check the most recent versions** (since updates might have occurred).
I typically update the slides from time to time to clarify issues raised by the students.
I do recommend that you simpy clone my teaching repository (done once) via

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/rkwitt/teaching.git rkwitt-teaching
```

and then regularly do a `git pull`:

```bash
cd ~/rkwitt-teaching
cd SS21
git pull
```
