# Machine Learning (PS)

In the PS to the *Machine Learning* course, we will solve exercises closely
related to the material we discuss during the lecture. Many of the exercises
are taken from the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David.

## News

- The PS starts on **Mon., March 4, 2019**

## Grading

Grading is based on exercise sheets. You can select that you want to solve. The completed exercises of a PS sheet need to be handed-in before the next PS in which we will discuss the solutions (be prepared to present your own).

Each exercise has a specific value (in points) and you have to have at least half of the total sum of the points of all exercises for a positive grade. However, I will also take the (1) type of solution strategy and (2) the presentation into account. Also, if someone has a good idea but a wrong solution, this will be appreciated.

**Note**: All exercise sheets have to be handed in online [here](https://abgaben.cosy.sbg.ac.at/).

When you want to log-in for the first time, you have to reset your password using your “Matrikelnummer” as a user name. All group members can potentially upload material for their group.
