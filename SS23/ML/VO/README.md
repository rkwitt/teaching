# Machine Learning (VO)

## News

- Lecture begins on **Tuesday, March 7, 2023** at **9:30am (T01)**

## Organization

The lecture will be held in person. In addition, I provide lecture videos from previous years, just in case you want to re-watch certain parts of the material. However, the material developed throughout the course (2023) is the **only** relevant resource for the exam.

*Remark: I do recommend that you watch the lecture videos in the provided order.*

## Slack channel

The Slack channel #machinelearning is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@plus.ac.at` or `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course.

## Lecture material

The course is rather self-contained and most of the material will be developed *step-by-step* on the blackboard (which is my iPad for a long time now :). I will obviously provide these written notes (so you can follow the lecture *without* having to keep detailed notes 
yourself).

Additionally, you can find much of the material in my supporting [slides](ml.pdf), and in the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David (see below), which is my main reference for the course. Another awesome book (although in slightly different notation here and there) is by Mohri, Rostamizadeh & Talwakar (see also below).

### Staying up-to-date

Please, **always check the most recent version** (since updates might have occurred) of this repository.
I do recommend that you simply clone my teaching repository via

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/rkwitt/teaching.git rkwitt-teaching
```

and then *regularly* do a `git pull`:

```bash
cd ~/rkwitt-teaching
git pull
cd SS23/ML
```

This gives you a clone of the *full* teaching repository. The only part relevant to the course is within `SS23/ML`.

### Lecture videos & Course notes

*For reference, you find videos (for most parts) of the material covered in the lecture below. The videos are from previous years (as mentioned above). In addition, you can also find my notes during the lecture (including the ones from earlier years). On some topics, my notes (for this year 2023) will differ to the notes from earlier years as I have left out parts or included new material. Relevant to the exam is obviously only the material covered in the summer term 2023.*
